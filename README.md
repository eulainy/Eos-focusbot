**Eos** is a personal, portable, gamified productivity tracker designed to help me focus on small tasks, track my progress, and stay motivated throughout the day. This project was developed to explore how breaking tasks into manageable steps and providing feedback can improve focus and productivity.

## Concept

I realized I work best when I have **small, well-defined tasks** and a clear plan to follow. Eos was created to help me:  

- Stay organized with **small, achievable tasks**  
- Track completion and see **visual feedback on progress**  
- Understand where I could **improve through data-driven insights**  
- Carry the tracker anywhere, whether at work or on the go  
- Reward myself after completing cycles to **stay motivated and consistent**  

## Features

- **Task tracking** for daily routines and work responsibilities  
- **Gamified points system** and optional avatar display  
- **Buzzer notifications** for task completion  
- **Portable design** to take anywhere  
- **Data logging** to analyze performance over time  
- **Feedback cycles** to highlight strengths and areas for improvement  
- **Personal rewards** for meeting consistency goals  

## How It Works

1. **Define small tasks** for the day  
2. **Track task completion** with points and visual cues  
3. **Log progress** over time to see patterns and improvement areas  
4. **Complete cycles** (e.g., every 15 days) and review feedback  
5. **Reward yourself** for maintaining consistency to reinforce habits  

## Goal

Eos was designed for **my own personal development**:  
- To help me manage a **busy schedule**  
- To reduce distractions from devices like my phone  
- To **build consistent habits** and improve productivity over time  

## Future Plans

- Add **avatar graphics** and customizable display themes  
- Build a **compact, 3D-printed case** for portability  
- Implement **advanced analytics** for deeper insights  
- Explore **AI integration** to suggest tasks, provide feedback, and enhance motivation
